# Sentiment_analysis


### üìÑ **Project Description:**

This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis system that classifies textual data (e.g., reviews or tweets) into different sentiment categories, primarily **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, the model learns to predict the sentiment conveyed in a given piece of text.

The aim is to automate the understanding of user emotions or opinions from large volumes of unstructured data, which is highly valuable in domains like customer feedback, product reviews, social media monitoring, and more.

### üéØ **Objectives:**

* Clean and preprocess raw textual data.
* Transform text into numerical format using feature extraction techniques.
* Train machine learning models to classify sentiment.
* Evaluate the models based on performance metrics.
* Predict the sentiment of unseen text data.

---

### üß∞ **Technologies & Tools Used:**

* **Language**: Python
* **Libraries**:

  * `pandas`, `numpy` for data handling
  * `re` and `nltk` for text preprocessing
  * `sklearn` for feature extraction, model training, and evaluation
  * `matplotlib`/`seaborn` for data visualization (if applicable)

---

### üîç **Workflow:**

1. **Data Loading**
   Import and inspect the dataset to understand its structure.

2. **Text Preprocessing**

   * Lowercasing
   * Removing punctuation and special characters
   * Tokenization and stopword removal
   * Lemmatization or stemming

3. **Feature Extraction**
   Convert cleaned text into numerical vectors using:

   * Bag of Words (BoW)
   * TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)

4. **Model Training**

   * Logistic Regression

5. **Model Evaluation**
   Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

6. **Prediction**
   Use the trained model to classify sentiment of new, unseen text inputs.

### üìä **Expected Outcomes:**

* A trained model capable of classifying sentiment with high accuracy.
* A user-friendly interface or script for predicting the sentiment of text.
* Visual insights into model performance and class distribution.
